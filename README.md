# rtf-parser

This is a general RTF parser.  It takes a text stream and produces a document
object representing the parsed document.  In and of itself, this isn't super
useful but it's the building block for other tools to convert RTF into other
formats.


```js
const parseRTF = require('@iarna/rtf-parser')
const fs = require('fs')

parseRTF.string('{\\rtf1\\ansi\\b hi there\\b0}', (err, doc) => {
  …
})

parseRTF.stream(fs.createReadStream('example.rtf'), (err, doc) => {
  …
})

const parser = parseRTF((err, doc) => {
  …
})
fs.createReadStream('example.rtf').pipe(parser)
```

RTF, unlike HTML, is NOT declarative and is instead a series of commands
that mutate document state.  As such, to accurately convert it you have to
load into something tha tracks that state, then emit chunks of text with
whatever that state was when they were emitted.

RTF, like HTML, allows (mostly) seamless degrading when you don't understand
an element.  As such, while this parser is still quite incomplete it is
already useful

The document returned is of the `RTFDocument` class, see below for details.

## RTF FEATURES SUPPORTED

* The following document code pages:<br>
  437, 737, 775, 850, 852, 853, 855, 857, 858, 860, 861, 863, 865, 866, 869,
  932, 1125, 1250, 1251, 1252, 1253, 1254, 1257
* Unicode characters.
* Non-unicode representations of: non-breaking spaces, soft hyphens and non-breaking hyphens.
* Paragraph alignment: center, justified, left and right
* Style resets.
* Setting the style to "plain".
* Bold, Italic, Underline and Strikethrough.
* Superscript and Subscript.
* first line indent (for indenting the first line of paragraphs)
* indent (for indenting the entire block)
* Fonts
  * The following font character sets:<br>
    ASCII, MacRoman, SHIFT_JIS, CP949, JOHAB, CP936, BIG5, CP1253, CP1254,
    CP1258, CP862, CP1256, CP1257, CP1251, CP874, CP238, CP437
* Colors (foreground and background) 
* Margins
* Text direction

## NOTABLY MISSING

Most notably, stylesheets, list styling and tables are not supported.  List
styling degrades cleanly but tables do not.  There are certainly other
required bits from the spec that are currently ignored.

## CLASSES

### RTFDocument

This is the class you get back from the parse functions.  It has some
document global options and the paragraph objects that make up the document.

* marginLeft, marginRight, marginBottom, marginTop — the margins for this document. These are in
  twips, which are one twentieth of a point.
* content — An array of RTFParagraph objects

### RTFParagraph

* style — An object with paragraph level styling information.
  * firstLineIndent
  * indent
  * align
  * valign

* content — An array of RTFSpan objects

### RTFSpan

* value — a string with the content of this region of text.
* style — an object with the span level styling infomration.
  * font
  * fontSize: In half points
  * bold: boolean
  * italic: boolean
  * underline: boolean
  * strikethrough: boolean
  * foreground: color (an object with red, green and blue values, 0-255)
  * background: color
  * dir (rtl or ltr)
